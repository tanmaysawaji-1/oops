## 🧠 Project Overview

This project simulates a simple payroll system that manages different types of employees and calculates their salaries based on their specific employment type. It uses core Java and fundamental OOP principles.

The system currently supports:
- Adding and removing employees
- Displaying employee details
- Calculating salaries dynamically for full‑time and part‑time employees

✔ Stores employee records using `ArrayList`  
✔ Console‑based user interaction  
✔ Separate logic for full‑time and part‑time salary computation
